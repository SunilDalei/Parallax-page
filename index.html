      </div>
      <h2 id="secHeading">Biking</h2>
      <p class="text">Biking is an activity that involves a bicycle. You can ride the bike on a road, bike path, a
        mountain trail, or rough terrain. Some use the term “biking” to refer specifically to a mountain biking context,
        and it is often associated with riding a heavy duty bicycle on rougher terrain. <br><br>

        Mountain biking usually takes place on mountain trails, dirt roads, or parks. It first originated as a sport in
        California, United States. The first bikers who engaged in the sport used a type of bike called cruiser
        bicycles. This single-speed bicycle comes with balloon tyres and an upright seating posture. It has fewer gears,
        which make it the perfect bike when you want to simply enjoy riding without thinking about what gears to
        control. Nowadays, people who engage in mountain biking and off-the-road biking use mountain bikes.

      </div>
      <h2 id="secHeading">Para Gliding ?</h2>
      <p class="text">
        paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities.
        Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a
        wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement
        through the air—the “ram-air” effect.
<br><br>
        The sport can be traced to the activities of French parachute inventor Pierre Lemoigne, who tow-launched his
        advanced round-parachute canopies in the 1950s. The ram-air-inflated cell structure originated in the early
        1960s with the kite and parachute designs of the Canadian-born American inventor Domina Jalbert. These designs
        evolved into steerable rectangular parachutes with relatively high forward speed. It was soon found that they
        had sufficient glide performance to allow them to be launched from steep slopes as well as by the aircraft
        deployment usual for parachutists.

        <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
      </div>
      <h2 id="secHeading">Surfing ?</h2>
      <p class="text">
        Surfing's roots lie in premodern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the sport was practiced by both men and women from
        all social strata from royalty to commoners. Early European explorers and travelers praised the skills of
        Hawaiian surfers, but 19th-century missionaries assigned to the islands disapproved of the “constant
        intermingling, without any restraint, of persons of both sexes” and banned the pastime. Surfing was practiced
        only sporadically in Hawaii by the end of the 19th century. <br>
<br>
        In the early 20th century, however, concomitant with the development of Hawaii as a tourist destination, surfing
        underwent a revival, and the sport quickly spread to California and Australia. Key to this diffusion were the
        American writer Jack London and the Hawaiian surfers George Freeth and Duke Kahanamoku. After visiting Waikiki,
        London published several accounts of surfing in popular American magazines; in 1907 the American industrialist
        Henry Huntington hired Freeth, whom he billed as the “man who can walk on water,” to help promote his new
        railway line to Redondo Beach. Surfing thus took hold in California. A few years later, after Kahanamoku won the
        100-metre freestyle event at the 1912 Olympic games, swimming officials from New South Wales invited him to
        Australia to demonstrate his swimming and surfing styles. In 1914 and 1915 Kahanamoku thrilled crowds in Sydney
        with his wave-riding skills, thus helping to establish the sport in Australia as well.
